# rock-paper-scissor

rock paper scissors project from TOP Foundations curriculum ; this will be a console-based program and my first original program from scratch in JS
I built the console-based skeleton from scratch, and then added in an original UI based in the browser. This was my first time building a javascript program completely from scratch. I definitely feel I'm a lot more comfortable manipulating the DOM after getting through this project. Looking forward to creating more interactive content on my pages as I progress.
