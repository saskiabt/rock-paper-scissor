# rock-paper-scissor

This project is a program to play Rock / Paper / Scissors against the computer, from TOP Foundations curriculum. The first iteration of the project will will be a console-based program, with a simple UI built in afterwards. This will be the first program I've written from scratch in JS. 

Reflections after completing the first build: 
I built the console-based skeleton, and then added in an original UI based in the browser. This was my first time building a javascript program completely independently and I definitely feel I'm a lot more comfortable manipulating the DOM after getting through it. Looking forward to creating more interactive content on my pages as I progress.
